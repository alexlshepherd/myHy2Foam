# myHy2Foam
Extension of the openFoam solver hy2Foam to include turbulent terms. Modified equation files to account for turbulent diffusive and heat transfer terms. The heat capacity and Mach number are now written to file. Heat capacity is now calculated using the total heat capacities, rather than just the translational-rotational parts.

This github page is in reference to a university research project and the code is not well tested, user discretion is advised. Contributions to the main hyStrath project will be done shortly.
